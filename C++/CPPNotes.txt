Had Cygwin gcc installed and updated with the bin directory on PATH.
    Visual Studio Code automatically picked up the g++ compiler.

Added a launch option in launch.json for the compiled executable.

Tried to install liquid-dsp to Cygwin.
    boostrap.sh would not run without autoconf.
    Needed to install wrapper for autoconf and both 2.1 and 2.5 versions.
    To get aclocal command to work, I needed to install automake 1.9.

MinGW-64
    Installed MinGW-64.
        Required setting up the proxy with the http_proxy environment variable.
        Downloaded the entire MinGW_64 repository.
            wget -r -N --no-parent --no-host-directories http://win-builds.org/1.5.0/packages/
        Downloaded win-builds 1.5.0.
            Needed to rename the executable to win-builds.exe.
        Installed MinGW into C:\MinGW_64
    Added C:\MinGW_64\bin to PATH.
