Had Cygwin gcc installed and updated with the bin directory on PATH.
    Visual Studio Code automatically picked up the g++ compiler.

Added a launch option in launch.json for the compiled executable.

Tried to install liquid-dsp to Cygwin.
    boostrap.sh would not run without autoconf.
    Needed to install wrapper for autoconf and both 2.1 and 2.5 versions.
    To get aclocal command to work, I needed to install automake 1.9.
