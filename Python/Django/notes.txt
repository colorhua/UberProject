Installed latest Django with:
    pip install Django

Started a Django project with:
    django-admin startproject testSite

To run the project, run in command line:
    python manage.py runserver

Created a new app inside testSite project named testApp:
    python manage.py startapp testApp

Made the testApp urls.py file
Modified the testSite urls.py file

Ran the server, then went to http://127.0.0.1:8000/testApp/

Ran:
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
        username: admin
        email: admin@example.com
        password: arstneio

Renamed main folder to learning_site because it does not matter what the enclosing directory name is.
    Right now, there is testSite folder, which is where all the global settings/parameters for this site exist.
    The testSite/urls.py file points to one application in the testApp folder and its urls.py file.
    The testApp/urls.py configures a blank url to point to 'index'.
    'index' refers to a function defined in testApp/views.py

Had a problem getting templates to work in my testApp.
    Found out I needed to add the app settings class 'testApp.apps.TestappConfig' to the INSTALLED_APPS list in testSite/settings.py.

Added a templates folder under testApp with a new folder 'testApp' and an index.html file inside. 
    The inner 'testApp' folder is to ensure it's in a unique namespace, so it must be referred to as 'testApp/index.html'.
