General Python Notes

Added Numba example at Reference/NumbaMultiThread.py
    pip install numba
    Cuda functionality seems to be available only through the Ananconda framework

Added PyCuda example at Reference/PyCudaRef.py
    pip install pycuda
    Got an error from the nvcc compiler that cl.exe was not on path.
        Added 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin' to my user Path environment variable and restarted Visual Studio Code
    This ran just fine, but PyLint seems to have trouble seeing pycuda functions and shows errors
        Found out this was because PyLint does not import C functions because of a security feature
        Disabled it by adding setting to User Settings:
            "python.linting.pylintArgs": [
                "--unsafe-load-any-extensions=yes"
            ]
