Installed JDK 10.0.1 from Oracle website
Changed JDK_HOME and JAVA_HOME system environment variables to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-10.0.1
Added C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-10.0.1\bin to PATH system environment variable

Installed Maven by download apache-maven-3.5.3-bin.zip from Maven website
    Unzipped apache-maven-3.5.3 folder into C:\
    Added C:\apache-maven-3.5.3\bin to system environment variables

Running mvn -v from command line now gives:
    Apache Maven 3.5.3 (3383c37e1f9e9b3bc3df5050c29c8aff9f295297; 2018-02-24T12:49:05-07:00)

Installed Java Extension Pack extension into VS Code
    This installs extensions:
        Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat
        Java Test Runner
        Debugger for Java
        Maven Project Explorer 

Needed to add proxy information into Maven settings.
    Added the following to C:\apache-maven-3.5.3\conf\settings.xml
        <proxies>
            <proxy>
                <id>MITRE</id>
                <active>true</active>
                <protocol>http</protocol>
                <host>gatekeeper.mitre.org</host>
                <port>80</port>
                <nonProxyHosts>127.0.0.1|localhost</nonProxyHosts>
            </proxy>
        </proxies>

Needed to add proxy information to VS Code
    Two ways to do it:
        Add system environment variable http_proxy=http://gatekeeper.mitre.org:80
        Add '"http.proxy": "http://gatekeeper.mitre.org:80"' to File->Preferences->Settings

To create Maven project, right-clicked on my project Java folder and selected Generate from Maven Archetype
    Selected the Java folder
    In Command Palette popup, selected maven-archetype-quickstart
    Lots of packages downloaded
    Used 'satellites' for both groupId and artifactId
    Used defaults for the next two

In the VS Code explorer, under MAVEN PROJECTS, right-clicked experiments and selected compile
    Had an error where compile source and target were version 1.5 and this was unsupported
        Found out I needed to add source and target Java versions in pom.xml under properties tag:
            <maven.compiler.source>10</maven.compiler.source>
            <maven.compiler.target>10</maven.compiler.target>

Running maven target 'test' on satellites project now worked

Added VS Code launch option by using Debug->Add Configuration...
    Added java launch and used satellites.App as main class
    I was getting "Build Failed" errors without explanation from Java Debugger extension
    This didn't work until I added the following settings to VS Code settings:
        "java.configuration.maven.userSettings": "C:\\apache-maven-3.5.3\\conf\\settings.xml"
        "java.home": "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-10.0.1"
    
Got sources and javadoc for the satellites project
    Ran these two commands in the satellites folder to download everything:
        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
    Then needed to run this command to update the project to point to them:
        mvn eclipse:eclipse
    
Used Maven shade plugin to build a deploy jar with all dependencies built-in.
    Added the shade plugin section in the pom.xml
    It uses a Manifest Transformer to create the main class in the jar manifest to make a runnable jar.
